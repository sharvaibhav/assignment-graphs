# The UI Cretion assumptions
* Taken 3 default options for the drop downs.
* We can search in the drop-downs.
* We can change the duration from the Duration selector
* Change the value the graph updates itself, no need to submit a button.

## Things to look for

* Calls to backend for ports happen only when u type atleast 3 characters, to Reduce the number of calls to back-end.
* Calls happen as you change the values.
